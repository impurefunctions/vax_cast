## [chapter 3](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/documentation/03.%20chapter%203%20-%20Create%20Relevant%20Patient%20Series.md) - How to find the series that are relevant for that patient
## [chapter 4](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/documentation/04.%20chapter%204%20-%20Evaluation%20Process%20Steps%20copy.md) - Logic behind evaluating the vaccination steps for doses that have already been given.
## [chapter 5](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/documentation/05.%20chapter%205%20-%20Forecast%20Dates%20and%20Reasons.md) - the logic behind the actual forecasting the next doses in the series. Still very much a work in progress.
