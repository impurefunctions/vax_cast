# Chapter 1 - Logic Specification Concepts
### (This is chapter 3 in the [CDC pdf](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/documentation/cdc/logic-spec-acip-rec-4.0.pdf))
## 1.1 Target Dose
#### When evaluating doses that have already been received, they are all viewed within the context of the target dose. As stated in the introduction, the target dose is the next dose in a series. In my code, I've defined the TargetDose as the index in the series as opposed to the actual TargetDose number. 
#### A TargetDose is said to be 'unsatisfied' until a dose matches all of its required criteria. At that time, the TargetDose is incremented by one. Below is a basic example from the CDC. 
![Figure 3-1](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/documentation/images/3-1%20How%20a%20Vaccine%20Dose%20Administered%20Satisfies%20a%20Target%20Dose)
#### *As a side note, anytime you see the term 'Vaccine Dose Administered' replace it with 'Dose Given', and it makes much more sense.
#### A patient series is considered complete when the TargetDose is >= the total number of doses in the series (again, because the TargetDose is the index). 
## 1.2 Statuses  
  
  TABLE 1-1 DOSE STATUS: recorded for each dose within each series
| Status       | Meaning         |
| ---------    |:-------------   |
| Extraneous   | Meaning the dose doesn't count towards the series, but doesn't need to be repeated (including maximum age and extra doses)              |
| Not Valid    | Not administered according to ACIP recommendations, does not count towards the series, will need to be repeated               |
| Sub-standard | Dose had a condition (e.g., expired, sub-potent, and recall) making it invalid, will need to be repated |
| Valid        | Meets ACIP requirements for that dose|

  TABLE 1-2 TARGET DOSE STATUSES: recorded for each dose within each series.
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|:------- |
| Not Satisfied | No dose given meets the target dose requirements|
| Satisfied | A dose has been given that meets target dose requirements |
| Skipped | No dose given meets requirements, but due to age/previous doses/other reasons, this target dose does not need to be satisfied and is skipped |

TABLE 1-3 PATIENT SERIES STATUSES: recorded for each series within the the antigen group
| Status          | Meaning |
|-------          |:--------|
| Aged Out        | Patient exceeded the maximum age prior to completing this series |
| Complete        | Patient has met all of the ACIP recommendations for this series |
| Contraindicated | Patient history indicates no more immunizations in this series should be given |
| Immune          | Patient has evidence of immunity, no further immunizations are needeed for this series |
| Not Complete    | Patient has not met all of the ACIP recommendations for this series|
| Not Recommended | Patient's immunization history provides sufficient immunity, and further doses in this series are not recommended |

## 1.3 ToDo: Supporting Logical Component Relevant
This is for recommendations, vaccinations, conditions, etc. Which have a beginning (effictive) and ending (cessation) date, and therefore don't always apply to the forecast. 

## 1.4 Date Calculations
I've defined and coded most of the date rules, uses and requirements into a class called [VaxDate](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/lib/features/immunizationForecast/domain/entities/vaxDate.dart).
This is certainly not required to calculate dates this way, but since I'm employing the rest of their logic, this is what I'm using. *Also, I'm not stating their rule IDs, I didn't find them helpful.

TABLE 1-6 GENERAL DATE RULES
| Business Rule | Example |
|:------|:--------------------------|
| When adding only years, <br> month and days stay constant | 01/01/2000 + 3 years = 01/01/2003 |
| When adding months, <br> day must stay constant | 01/01/2000 + 6 months = 07/01/2000 <br> 11/01/2000 + 6 months = 05/01/2001 |
| When adding weeks or days, <br> add that total number of days <br> to the existing date | 01/01/2000 + 3 days = 01/04/2000 <br> 01/01/2000 + 3 weeks = 01/22/2000 <br> 02/01/2000 + 5 weeks = 03/07/2000 (leap year) <br> 02/01/2001 + 5 weeks = 03/08/2001 (not a leap year) |
| Subtracting days is just subtracting <br> days from the date (I've implemented <br> it as just negative addition | 01/15/2000 – 4 days = 01/11/2000 |
| If the calculated date isn't a real date, <br> it is moved to the first of the next month | 03/31/2000 + 6 months = 10/01/2000 (September 31 does not exist) <br> 08/31/20010 + 6 months = 03/01/2001 (February 31 does not exist) |
| Date must be calculated by first years, <br> then months, then weeks/days <br> (ToDo: not sure I completely did this) | 01/31/2000 + 6 months – 4 days = 07/27/2000 |

It's important to note, and it took me a while to catch onto their wording, there are ages and age dates. They are what they say they are, but I struggled with them at first. An age (or an interval) is a string description of a period of time ('4 years', '19 years - 4 days', etc) these are supposed to be added (or subtracted) to a date (usually the DOB, although sometimes the date given of the previous dose). Also, these terms probably won't all make as much sense until you work through it some more

TABLE 1-7 LOGICAL COMPONENT DATE RULES: some of these seem repetitive and probably unnecessary to put here
ToDo: get rid of these age dates that I don't actually use
| Business Rule | Caclulation |
|:------|:--------------------|
| Maximum age date | DOB + maximum age |
| Latest recommended age date | DOB + latest recommended age |
| Earliest recommended age date | DOB + earliest recommended age | 
| Minimum age date | DOB + minimum age |
| Absolute minimum age date | DOB + absolute minimum age |
| Allowable vaccine type begin age date | DOB + vaccine type begin age (only applied for allowable vaccines) |
| Allowable vaccine type end age date | DOB + vaccine type end age (only applied for allowable vaccines) |
| Contraindication begin age date | DOB + contraindication begin age (for either an antigen or a vaccine) |
| Contraindication end age date | DOB + contraindication end age (for either an antigen or a vaccine) |
| Indication begin age date | DOB + indication begin age |
| Indication end age date | DOB + indication end age |
| Reference dose date: when evaluating intervals, sometimes this is from teh previous dose, soemetimes from another dose in the series (usually the first) |
| Reference Dose Date: doses will have an interval entry/recommendation, this is calculated from the immediate previous dose if: <br> - an interval entry with "FromPrevious" dose is "Y" <br> - the dose being evaluated has status of 'Valid' or Not Valid' <br> - (ToDo: current?) vaccine dose is not an inadvertent administration |"interval": [{<br> "fromPrevious": "Y", <br> "fromTargetDose": null, <br> "minInt": "4 weeks" }] |
| Reference dose date is calculated from a different dose in the series (and the interval is therefore calcluated from the date of that dose) if the following are true: <br> - the interval entry states immediate previous dose administered is 'N'<br> - the interval entry target dose number is not null | "interval": [{ <br> "fromPrevious": "N", <br> "fromTargetDose": "1",<br> "minInt": "6 months" }] |
| Reference dose date is calculated from the most recent dose of the same vaccine type if the following are true: <br> - the "FromPrevious" is "N" <br> - "fromMostRecent" is not null <br> - the current dose is not an inadvertent administration| "interval": [{ <br> "fromPrevious": "N", <br> "fromTargetDose": null, <br> "fromMostRecent": "21; 94; 121", <br> "absMinInt": "0 days", <br> "minInt": "8 weeks" }] |
| Reference dose date is calculated from an observation if: <br> - "fromPrevious" is "N" <br> - "fromRelevantObs" is not null | "interval": [{ <br> "fromPrevious": "N", <br> "fromTargetDose": null, <br> "fromMostRecent": null, <br> "fromRelevantObs": { <br> "text": "Date of hematopoietic stem cell transplant", <br> "code": "171" },<br> "earliestRecInt": "6 months", <br> "latestRecInt": "12 months" }] |
| Absolute minimum interval date | date reference dose was given + absolute minimum interval |
| Minimum interval | date reference dose was given + minimum interval |
| Earliest recommended interval date | date reference dose was given + earliest recommended interval |
| Latest recommended interval date | date reference dose was given + latest recommended interval |
| Latest minimum interval date | if there is more than one interval specified (such as from previous and from a target dose), whichever comes later |
| Conflict begin interval date | date given of the conflicting dose + live virus conflict begin interval | 
|Conflict end interval date | date given of the conflicting dose + live virus **MINIMUM CONFLICT** end interval if the conflicting dose **HAS** evaluation status of valid |
| Conflict end interval date | date given of the conflicting dose + live virus **CONFLICT** end interval if the conflicting dose **DOES NOT HAVE** evaluation status of valid |
| Latest conflict end interval date | if there is more than one interval specified (such as from previous and from an observation), whichever comes later |
| Preferable vaccine type begin age date | DOB + vaccine type begin age of a preferable vaccine |
| Conditional skip begin age date | DOB + begin age of the conditional skip condition |
| Conditional skip end age date | DOB + end age of the conditional skip condition |
| Conditional skip interval date | date given of the immediate previous dose + interval of the conditional skip condition |
