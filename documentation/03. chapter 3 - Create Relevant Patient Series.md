# Chapter 3 - Create Relevant Patient Series
## 3.1
#### For discriminating series, they are first divided into 'Standard' series and 'Risk' series.
* Standard Series: appropriate for anyone of the correct gender.
* Risk Series: appropriate for those with certain 'conditions' (in this context, conditions do not just refer to medical conditions, but may also refer to exposure, travel to endemic areas, etc). If a Risk series cannot be definitely applied to a patient, then it is not used in the forecast (but a notification should be sent to the clinician alerting them to this fact).

Here is an example of what a series looks like:
```
{
    "seriesName": "Meningococcal ACWY risk start before 7 months 4-dose series",
    "targetDisease": "Meningococcal",
    "seriesVaccineGroup": "Meningococcal",
    "seriesAdminGuidance": "If MenACWY-D is used, it should be administered at least 4 weeks after completion of all PCV doses.",
    "seriesType": "Risk",
    "equivalentSeriesGroups": null,
    "requiredGender": null,
    "defaultSeries": "No",
    "productPath": "No",
    "seriesGroupName": "Increased Risk",
    "seriesGroup": "2",
    "seriesPriority": "A",
    "seriesPreference": null,
    "minAgeToStart": "2 months",
    "maxAgeToStart": "7 months",
    "indication": [
        {
            "observationCode": {
                "text": "Persons at risk during an outbreak",
                "code": "070"
            },
            "description": "Administer to persons identified as at increased risk during a community outbreak attributable to a vaccine serogroup",
            "beginAge": "2 months",
            "endAge": null,
            "guidance": null
        },
```
Each series starts with fields similar to the ones above. 
#### Gender - Note that in this series gender and sex are used synonymously for consistency in the logic. FOR THESE PURPOSES ONLY they refer to the same thing, and that is the genetic sex at birth. If you don't understand why there might be differences in sex and gender (and gender identity), please consider reading any of the following articles by the [AMA](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/sex-gender-and-why-differences-matter/2008-07), [Stanford](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2017spring/how-sex-and-gender-which-are-not-the-same-thing-influence-our-health.html), and [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/sex-gender-identity). 

If there is a required gender, it is specified here. In the current state, there are actually only three possibilites in this field. Null, "Male" or "Unknown". Null can obviously apply to anyone. "Male" only applies if the patient's gender is known and is male. "Unknown" is not the same as Null. "Unknown" is only if you don't know the patient's gender, or if the patient's gender is "Female". (when actually looking through the info, this only comes up for the HPV vaccine, and for the 1-dose Pertussis series for pregnant women).

#### Risk Series
Here's an ideal example of one of the sentences I think was written by a computer: *Is the observation of the indication one of the observations of the patient?*. This translates to: for each series, there may be indications. If there are indications, each indication will contain an 'observationCode' field wich contains a 'code' field. In this context, an observationCode means condition (and again, for our purposes, a condition may be a chronic disease, but may also be an exposure, travel, etc). Observations [(defined here)](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/lib/features/immunizationForecast/data/datasources/scheduleSupportingData/observations.json) contain SNOMED codes if it is a diagnosable condition. So, the patient has SNOMED conditions, you map them to observationCodes, then check if these observationCodes are included as an indication for that specific VaccineSeries. If it is, the series applies to the patient.

Thus, final logic, the series is relevant if it is:
1. Appropriate for the patient's gender
* And One of the Following

    2. A 'Standard' Series
    3. A 'Risk' series which applies to the patient

[*forecast.dart*](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/lib/domain/immunizationForecast/forecast/forecast.dart)
```
  bool isRelevant(Series series) {
    gender = VaxPatient.sex;
    var appropriateGender = isAppropriateGender(series.requiredGender);
    var isStandardSeries = series.seriesType == 'Standard';
    var indicationApplies =
        !isStandardSeries ? doesIndicationApply(series.indication) : null;
    return (appropriateGender && (isStandardSeries || indicationApplies));
  }

  bool isAppropriateGender(String requiredGender) {
    //if for some reason we don't know the patient's gender, we assume it's appropriate
    if (requiredGender != null) {
      if (gender != null) {
        return !(requiredGender.toLowerCase() == 'male' &&
                gender.toLowerCase() == 'female' ||
            requiredGender.toLowerCase() == 'female' &&
                gender.toLowerCase() == 'male' ||
            requiredGender.toLowerCase() == 'unknown' &&
                gender.toLowerCase() == 'male');
      } else {
        return requiredGender.toLowerCase() == 'male';
      }
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  }

  bool doesIndicationApply(Map<String, Indication> indicationList) {
    if (conditions != null) {
      for (final condition in conditions) {
        if (indicationList.keys.contains(condition.code)) {
          var indication = indicationList[condition.code];
          if (dob.minIfNull(indication.beginAge) <= assessmentDate &&
              assessmentDate < dob.maxIfNull(indication.endAge)) {
            return true;
          }
        }
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
```
