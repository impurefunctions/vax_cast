# Chapter 5 Forecast Dates and Reasons
## 5.1 Evaluate Conditional Skip

I'll come back to this, I promise! (ToDo: this)

## 5.2 Determine Evidence of Immunity

The beginning of most antigenSupportingData sections have an "immunity": null entry. However, a few look something like this:
```
"antigenSupportingData": {
    "immunity": {
        "clinicalHistory": [
            {
                "guidelineCode": "023",
                "guidelineTitle": "Laboratory Evidence of Immunity or confirmation of Varicella disease"
            }
        ],
        "dateOfBirth": {
            "immunityBirthDate": "01/01/1980",
            "birthCountry": "U.S.",
            "exclusion": [
                {
                    "exclusionCode": "055",
                    "exclusionTitle": "Health care personnel"
                }
            ]
        }
```

We use this information to determine if the patient has evidence of immunity. It's important to note, the *guidelineCode* and *exclusionCode* are the same as *observationCode* [in this file](https://github.com/Dokotela/FhirVCA/blob/master/lib/infrastructure/immunizationForecast/scheduleSupportingData/observations.json). So we need to map these codes to the observation codes to see if they're applicable to the patient.

| Conditions | Rules |||||
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Does the patient have a condition that's identified in one of the guidelineCodes for that series? | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Is the patient's DOB < immunity birth date? | - | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
|Does the patient have an exclusion condition? | - | Yes | No | No | - |
|Is the patient's country of birth the same as the birthCountry? | - | - | Yes | No | - |
|||||||
| Evidence of Immunity? | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | 

I think there are two things to note about this logic (please let me know if you disagree with it). The first is that if the patient has **ANY** immunity defined condition, then they have evidence of immunity. Otherwise, they **MUST** have been bored prior to the defined birthdate. The immunity exclusion criteria must then be reviewed. If the patient has **ANY** of these criteria, then they **DO NOT** have evidence of immunity. Lastly, they must be born in the designated country. 

```
checkForImmunity(String ag) {
  if (VaccinePatient.conditions != null) {
    if (SupportingData.antigenSupportingData[ag].immunity != null) {
      print(SupportingData.antigenSupportingData[ag].series[0].seriesName);
      var immuneConditions =
          SupportingData.antigenSupportingData[ag].immunity;
      immuneConditions.clinicalHistory.forEach((condition) =>
          evidenceOfImmunity = evidenceOfImmunity ||
              VaccinePatient.conditions.contains(condition));
      if (immuneConditions.dateOfBirth != null) {
        if (VaccinePatient.dob <
            VaxDate.format(immuneConditions.dateOfBirth.immunityBirthDate)) {
          var isThereExclusionCondition = false;
          immuneConditions.dateOfBirth.exclusion.forEach((exclusion) =>
              isThereExclusionCondition = isThereExclusionCondition ||
                  VaccinePatient.conditions.contains(exclusion));
          if (!isThereExclusionCondition) {
            evidenceOfImmunity = false;
          } else {
            evidenceOfImmunity = true;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So once again, if they have any 'clinicalHistory' they are immune. If they are born before the birth date, have NO exclusion criteria AND are born in the correct country, they also have immunity. Otherwise, they don't.

## 5.3 Determine Contraindications

Kind of tired and don't want to do this just now.

## 5.4 Determine Forecast Need

This is summarizing the information we have up to this point about each of the series and using it to decide if the patient needs another dose.
| Conditions | Rules |||||||
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Has the patient completed all doses in the series? <br> Is there at least one target dose 'not satisfied'? | Yes | No | No | - | - | - | - |
| Is there at least one dose with a status of satisfied? | - | Yes | No | - | - | - | - |
| Is there evidence of immunity? | No | - | - | Yes | - | - | - |
| Is the series contraindicated? | No | - | - | - | Yes | - | - |
| Is the assessment date < maximum age date? | Yes | - | - | - | - | No | - |
Is the assessment date <= seasonal recommendation end date? | Yes | - | - | - | - | - |
| Needs another dose? | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | No |
| Series Status | 'not complete' | 'complete' | 'not recommended' | 'immune' | 'contraindicated' | 'aged out' | 'not complete' |
| Forecast Reason | - | 'series is complete' | 'not recommended due to past immunization hx' | 'patient has evidence of immunity' | 'patient has contraindication' | 'patient has exceeded maximum age' | 'past seasonal recommendation end date' |

```
  shouldPatientReceiveAnotherTargetDose(bool evidenceOfImmunity) {
    var dob = VaccinePatient.dob;
    if (currentTargetDose >= series.seriesDose.length) {
      var satisfied = false;
      Dose.forEach((dose) =>
          satisfied = satisfied || dose.targetDoseStatus == 'satisfied');
      if (satisfied) {
        needsAnotherDose = false;
        seriesStatus = 'Complete';
        seriesStatus = 'patient series is complete.';
      } else {
        needsAnotherDose = false;
        seriesStatus = 'Not Recommended';
        forecastReason =
            'not recommended at this time due to past immunization history.';
      }
    } else if (evidenceOfImmunity) {
      needsAnotherDose = false;
      seriesStatus = 'Immune';
      forecastReason = 'patient has evidence of immunity';
    }
    //ToDo: is the series contraindicated
    else if (VaccinePatient.assessmentDate >
        dob.maxIfNull(series.seriesDose[currentTargetDose].age[0].maxAge)) {
      needsAnotherDose = false;
      seriesStatus = 'Aged Out';
      forecastReason = 'patient has exceeded the maximum age.';
    } else if (series.seriesDose[currentTargetDose].seasonalRecommendation ==
        null) {
      needsAnotherDose = true;
      seriesStatus = 'Not Complete';
    } else if (VaccinePatient.assessmentDate >
        VaxDate.fromDateTime(DateTime.parse(series
            .seriesDose[currentTargetDose].seasonalRecommendation.endDate))) {
      needsAnotherDose = false;
      seriesStatus = 'Not Complete';
      forecastReason = 'past seasonal recommendation end date.';
    } else {
      needsAnotherDose = true;
      seriesStatus = 'Not Complete';
    }
  }
```

## 5.5 Generate Forecast Dates and Recommended Vaccines

Again, this is one of those cases where I don't feel like the logic is clear. The idea is though. This is where we determine when the next dose, if any, for that particular antigen/series is needed and when it is due. So far we've been through each antigen that could be applicable to the patient. Within each antigen we've evaluated all of the possible series that exist, and decided which of those were appropriate for the patient. We evaluated each of the doses given to the patient against each series to see how many doses are valid within the constraints of that series. Just above we decided if the patient needs another dose in that series. If they do, we create a recommended dose for that series. It will have the following specifications.

| Attribute Name | Description |
|----------------|:------------|
| Minimum age date | DOB + minimum age for the current target dose |
| Earliest recommended age date | DOB + earliest recommended age for current target dose |
| Latest recommended age date | DOB + latest recommended age date for the current target dose |
| Maximum age date | DOB + maximum age for the current target dose |
| Minimum interval date(s) | List of dates, recall intervals may be from preceeding dose or another dose in series. This list includes all dates, calculated from the referenced dose + the minimum interval |
| Latest minimum interval date | the latest of the above dates |
| Earliest recommended interval date(s) | as above, a list of dates, calculated from the referenced dose + earliest recommended interval | 
| Latest of all earliest recommended interval date | terrible wording, chronologically the last in the above list |
| Latest recommended interval date(s) | again, a list of dates, referenced dose + latest recommended interval |
| Latest of all latest recommended interval date | again a poor name, but the chronologically last from the list above |
| (ToDo) Conflict end interval date(s) | a list of dates, the calculated conflict end interval dates for a given target dose |
| (ToDo) Latest conflict end interval date | the latest date from the above list |
| (ToDo) Seasonal recommendation start date | given for the target dose, if null, then '01/01/1900' |
| Earliest date | the *LATEST* of the following dates: <br><ul><li> Minimum age date <li> Latest minimum interval date <li> Latest conflict end interval date <li> Seasonal recommendation start date <li> Latest inadvertent administration date </ul> |
| Unadjusted recommended date | <ul><li>The earliest recommended age date <li> if the above is null, then the latest of all earliest recommended interval date <li> if the above is null, the earliest date (the date just calculated above) </ul> |  
| Unadjusted past due date | <ul><li>The latest recommended age date - 1 day <li> if the above is null, the latest of all latest recommended interval date - 1 day <li> if the above is null, then this date is null <ul>|
| Latest date | if maximum age date = null, this is null, otherwise maximum age date - 1 day |
| Adjusted recommended date | whichever comes later between the earliest date and the unadjusted recommended date |
| Adjusted past due date | If the unadjusted past due date is not present, then this is null, otherwise it is whichever comes llater between the earliest date and the unadjusted past due date |
| (ToDo) Vaccination Administration Guidance | the guidance for the series + the guidance for any indications which apply to the patient |
| (ToDo) Recommended Vaccines | if the vaccine is to be recommended, in the "preferableVaccine" section for the target dose, the field "forecastVaccineType" must be "Y", and the vaccine must not be contraindicated |

## 5.6 Validate Recommendation

### 5.6.1
ToDo: if the recommended dose should be skipped, then it's the next dose that needs to be recommended

### 5.6.2 
If the earliest date is later than the latest date in the series, it means the patient is aged out, and the following should be noted:
<ul><li> Patient series status is 'aged out' <li> forecast reason is 'patient is unable to finish the series prior to the maximum age' <li> there is no forecast earliest date <li> there is no forecast adjusted recommended date <li> there is no forecast adjusted past due date <li> there is no forecast latest date </ul>
